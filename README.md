# Dating App
Based on Udemy course, "*Build an app with ASPNET Core and ~~Angular~~ from scratch*" by Neil Cummings, with a ***Major Twist*** -- the client-side application is built entirely using ASP.NET Core ***Blazor WebAssembly***.  
  
This project is all about learning ASP.NET Core Web API, ASP.NET Core Blazor WebAssembly, Entity Framework and MudBlazor.  It is an undertaking for both learning, personal growth, and evaluation of this technology stack for real-world uses.

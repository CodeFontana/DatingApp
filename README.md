Based on Udemy course, "Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch" by Neil Cummings-- except I decided to build a Blazor Webassembly app for building the client, instead of the Angular application built in the course. I feel like when Neil produced this course in the .NET Core 3.1 era, an Angular app was absolutely the right choice. As I have the advantage of starting with .NET 5.0, I thought I would add a twist and attempt to develop the client-side app in Blazor WASM. This would be a good test of my recent Blazor skills, as well as a proof of concept to see if Blazor is up to the task against other frameworks.  It is also quite pleasant to be writing the entire stack in C#-- letâ€™s hope it delivers!

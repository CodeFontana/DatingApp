Based on Udemy course, "Build an app with ASPNET Core and Angular from scratch" by Neil Cummings-- except I decided to build a Blazor Webassembly app for building the client, instead of the Angular application built in the course. I feel like when Neil produced this course in the .NET Core 3.1 era, an Angular app was absolutely the right choice. As I have the advantage of starting with .NET 5.0, I thought I would add a twist and attempt to develop the client-side app in Blazor WASM. This would be a good twist on the course, a good test of my recent Blazor skills, and a proof of concept for me, that Blazor WASM is ready, supporting all the necessary features to go head to head with other frameworks. It's also just so nice to be using C# for both the client and server-side code.
